\title{Compute Capital Stock}
\usage{
CompK(
  yr = NULL,
  invest = NULL,
  InvestPrice = NULL,
  delta = 0.096,
  prv,
  bt = 1952
)
}
\arguments{
\item{yr}{a numeric vector about years. If you only need capital stock before 2017,
you can use its default. If you need to compute capital stocks in other
years (for example 2018,2019), you can set, for example, \code{yr = c(2018,2019)}.}

\item{invest}{a numeric vector about investment, its length equal the length of
\code{yr}, and its units is 100 million in current price.}

\item{InvestPrice}{a numeric vector about price indices of investment,
its length equal the length of \code{yr}, and it is a fixed base index
with equaling 1 in 1952.}

\item{delta}{rate of depreciation, a scalar number.}

\item{prv}{a province name, a scalar character.}

\item{bt}{a numeric scalor, such as 2000. It means computing capital stock with its price equal
1 in \code{bt}}
}
\value{
The function return a data.frame, and its 1st coloume is province, 2nd column
is year, 3rd column is capital stock, 4th column is the price index of investment.
}
\description{
This function compute capital stock of provinces in China using Zhang et al. (2004).
Note the capital stock is real economic variable, its price is 1 in 1952.
}
\note{
The parameter\code{InvestPrice} is a fixed base index with equaling 1 in 1952.
However, we often only get a price indices of investment with equaling 1
in last year. You can use \code{data(asset)} to get \code{InvestPrice}
in any year (before 2017) with equaling 1 in 1952. So, it is easy then.

\examples{
# Compute capital stock in Xinjiang province in 1952-2017
CompK(prv = '鏂扮枂')
# Compute capital stock in Xinjiang province in 1952-2017 with its price equaling 1 in 2000
CompK(prv = '鏂扮枂', bt = 2000)
# compute capital stock in Beijing in 2018 and 2019
CompK(yr = 2018:2019, invest = c(10801.2,11100),
   InvestPrice = c(1.86*1.03,1.86*1.03*1.021),
   prv = '鍖椾含',delta = 0.096)
# ...
# 鍖椾含 2018 35023.74246
# 鍖椾含 2019 37336.21755
